Prototype Spice Javascript client

Instructions and status as of June 1, 2012.

Requirements:

  1.  Modern Firefox or Chrome
      
  2.  A WebSocket proxy

      I've used websockify:
        https://github.com/kanaka/websockify
      works great.


  3.  A spice server

      At this point, I've tested with qemu hosting
      a Fedora image, a Vista image, and with Xspice.  
      Vista was pretty bad; I recommend either Linux or Xspice.

      ** Xspice has a processing issue; see this email:
         http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/spice-devel/2012-May/009020.html


Optional:
  1.  A web server

      With firefox, you can just open file:///your-path-to-spice.html-here

      With Chrome, you have to set a secret config flag to do that, or 
      serve the files from a web server.


Steps:

  1.  Start the spice server

  2.  Start websockify; my command line looks like this:
        ./websockify 5959 localhost:5900

  3.  Fire up spice.html, set host + port + password, and click start


Status:

  The TODO file should be a fairly comprehensive list of tasks
  required to make this client more fully functional.

  As of June 1, 2012, this client is a nifty proof of concept,
  but a long way from being a useful production tool.
